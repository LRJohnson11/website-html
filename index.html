        <p>
          I'm a BYU student studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I'm a winter person for everything, but I suffer summers to get the breathtaking views of the stars without freezing my fingers off. I enjoy photography, skiing, any kind of games, fixing anything, amateur radio, and just about anything nerdy in the world.

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>
          I am something of an amateur cook, and I enjoy making up recipes as I go. a common recipe for me to follow when making country fried steak includes the following:

        </p>
        <p>
          Ingredients:
          <ol>
            <li>cube steaks</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>hot sauce</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>

        <p>
          start by getting two bowls. in one bowl, mix eggs, milk, and hot sauce. in another, mix flour and spices. cover each piece of meat in the egg bath, then cover with the breading mixture.

        </p>
        <p>
          after breading each of the steaks, heat oil until hot. 
        </p>
        <p>
          fry steaks one or two at a time. be careful to make sure steaks cook all the way through; until the center is no longer pink. (cube steaks may be slightly less safe to serve with pink centers given the way they are tenderized).

        </p>
        <p>
          when finished, serve the steaks with homemade mashed potatoes, gravy, vegetables and biscuits/cornbread
